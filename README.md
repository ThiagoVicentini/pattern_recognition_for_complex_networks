# Pattern recognition for complex networks

Project for the complex networks course. This project consist in a simple knn algorithm to classify the structure of a given network based on several measurements like momment of degree distribution, variance, average clustering coefficient, average shortest path length, degree assortativity coefficient, etc...

The code was based on the article:  
 L da F Costa, P R Villas Boas, F N Silva and F A Rodrigues. 2010, A pattern recognition approach to complex networks, {IOP} Publishing, doi:10.1088/1742-5468/2010/11/P11015

 In that project, 9 networks were classified, they were divided in 3 groups: social networks, biological networks and technological networks.
